        Hi, I'm Steve. I've been around the internet for quite a while now.
        These days, I work on various web projects for
        <a href="https://www.insynchq.com">work</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/marksteve">fun and open source</a>.
        My dream is to make my own game.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also like joining and talking in local tech meetups.
        I'm a board member of
        <a href="http://python.ph">Python.PH Inc.</a>
        and a co-organizer of
        <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Manila/">Docker Manila</a>.
        You'll also find me in
        <a href="/hackathons.html">hackathons</a>
        and other local tech events. If you bump to me in one, don't be shy and say hi!
      </p>
      <p>
        In case you're interested in what I have to say (which I highly doubt),
        you can find me
        <a href="http://blog.marksteve.com">blogging</a>
        and
        <a href="http://twitter.com/themarksteve">tweeting</a>
        every now and then.
        I'm also always
        <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/hireyuki">game</a>
        for a round of Dota 2.
