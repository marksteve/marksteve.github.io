Always look on the bright side of life! _\*whistling\*_

* __New rig__ - My windows laptop died the other year so I needed a replacement to satisfy my gaming needs. I got myself a new box (literally a box) with medium tier parts.
* __Learned Django__ - Finally learned Django after years of programming in Python. My first project was [this job board](https://python.ph/jobs/).
* __New Insync office__ - Insync moved to a house in Xavierville Ave, Loyola Heights. QC represent!
* __Baked without mixes__ - Not by myself but helped throughout the process. And it was really good!
* __Taught Django__ - Got to teach basic Django in one of DevCon's [code camps](http://devcon.ph/events/python-code-camp-professionals). I presented the process of creating a [Tinder clone](https://github.com/marksteve/devcon-django-workshop) (what? it was hip then) using Django. I also mentored in the first [Django Girls Manila workshop](https://djangogirls.org/manila/).
* __Surfed__ - Got to try out surfing in Baler. That proved useful when we went to Siargao later in the year.
* __Attended my first non-relative wedding__ - Not really an achievement but I wanted to add it to the list. Congrats [Ton and Ana](https://tonandana.com/)!
* __Koh Phangan__ - Let's mix in some travel. Koh Phangan is as beautiful as it was when I first saw it a few years ago. There were a lot more commercial establishments though.
* __Started sport climbing__ - I got better than I was back in P.E. Still not good enough to be considered "good at it". Outdoors was really fun! A lot scarier but the view is way more gorgeous.
* __Helped organize PyCon PH__ - It's my third time helping out. Good people makes it easy to volunteer.
* __New job__ - Not technically a new job but I left Insync to focus on a [startup](https://blankhq.com) I've co-founded. It's one of the biggest decisions I made this year.
* __Siargao__ - Best adventure of my entire life so far. Waves, motorbikes and appreciating nature's beauty and scale. Best birthday ever!
* __Gave a keynote talk__ - DevCon gave me the chance to do a keynote talk at their [annual conference](http://summit.devcon.ph/). I admittedly didn't deliver a keynote-level talk but watching the good speakers throughout the event made me want to really improve.
* __Sydney__ - One of the most pleasant places I've been to and it couldn't have been better with the good friends  I was with.

Inspired by [this blog post](http://unredacted.redalemeden.com/2015/achievement-unlocked-2015/). Happy 2016!
