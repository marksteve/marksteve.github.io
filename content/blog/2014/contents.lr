The year is almost over. I’ve always had a new blog to write on whenever I do
my year-ender posts but I’ve stuck with Svbtle for this year! _It just works
™_

So, I basically checked my timeline in Facebook, Twitter and GitHub and stuck
moments here #lazyblogging (NTS: I could totally automate this!) Here’s my

  * Beer pong for the first time

# This year, I also…

## Started liking beer

For the longest time, I didn’t like the taste of beer. I guess it’s an
acquired taste.

## Cut down coffee intake

My stomach can’t handle it anymore. But I feel better. I sleep better. I still
grab a cup every once and a while but I’m not a fan of caffeine anymore.

## Started working out again

Beato, a relatively new employee in my company, loves working out. We do too
but we lacked discipline. He started pushing us to work out more since he
joined us full time. First he brought jump ropes. Then we did resistance
bands. Now we use our boss’ squat rack and weights set. We’ve been progressing
enough that we bought additional plates! Here are my sad numbers:

  * Barbell Squats - 235lb x 3
  * Deadlift - 265lb x 3
  * Standing Barbell Shoulder Press (OHP) - 135lb x 1
  * Barbell Bench Press - 195lb x 1

## Got into OPM indie rock

I got to watch a bunch of OPM indie bands early this year at Route 196. Since
then, I’ve started to listening to more indie OPM. Here’s John Arce’s
Philippine Indie Music playlist:

# 2014 was about getting out of my comfort zone

I tried to be more socially active than I ever was and that paid off good. I
met lots of people and got new friends. I still need to work on my people
skills but I could say I grew up this year, even just a little.

An early happy new year to everyone!
