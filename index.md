## Hi! Nice to meet you.<br>You can call me Steve.

I'm a self-taught web developer and open source enthusiast who dreams of
creating his own game someday. Right now, I work on various web projects
for [work](https://www.insynchq.com) and for
[fun](https://github.com/marksteve).

I love [Python](http://python.org). My friends and I volunteer
to help spread news of Python's awesomeness. We maintain the
[local community](http://python.ph), hold
[meetups](http://www.meetup.com/pythonph/), and organize an
annual [conference](http://ph.pycon.org).

I help organize [Docker Manila](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Manila/) meetups,
and regularly show up to [Manila.js](http://manilajs.com/) events.

If you're interested in the other things I write about,
you can find me [blogging](http://blog.marksteve.com)
and [tweeting](http://twitter.com/themarksteve) every now and then.
